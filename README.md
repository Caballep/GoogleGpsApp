# GoogleGpsApp

GoogleGpsApp is a small educational/demo project that allows users to save and manage their locations based on their current GPS data. With GoogleGpsApp, users can easily save locations, delete them, view detailed information, and visualize the locations on Google Maps.

**Project Structure and Architecture:**

The project follows the principles of CLEAN Architecture to ensure a clear separation of concerns and maintainable codebase.
Dependencies:

**Hilt**: Used for dependency injection, making it easier to manage and provide dependencies throughout the project.

**Coroutines**: Leveraged for asynchronous programming and managing background tasks efficiently.

**Room**: Utilized as the database library for storing and managing location data persistently.

**Play Services**: Integrated to access the device's location services and retrieve GPS data.

**Compose**: Adopted as the UI toolkit for building a modern and reactive user interface.
By combining these powerful libraries and technologies, GoogleGpsApp offers a seamless user experience in managing and exploring their saved locations.
